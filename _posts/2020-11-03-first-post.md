# Election day!

Despite all the ~~doom and gloom~~, the disruptions to normal life due to the 'pandemic', and the challanges of the last few years - I am feeling ok. I am working on a few personal projects (and have a bunch more that I would like to work on) and am finally getting organized (emacs helps) Hopefully I will be getting a few more certifications in the IT field next year, I am hoping to have a job in the next 2 months, and I am learning Python at a fairly fast pace.
