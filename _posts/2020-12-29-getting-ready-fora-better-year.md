# Plans for '21
## Things I will learn
1. Javascript
2. Docker
3. Ansible
4. I am going to finally learn to draw

## Things I will do
1. Finish at least one song
2. Write something worth finishing at least once a week
3. Finish getting back into shape


## Thoughts...

I am fairly sure my plans are almost identical to everyone else's - most people want to be more motivated than they are and waste less time...
