# Organization

## I am working out a system to stay organized
### So far I have experimented with 
- **taskbook** - I like the way it looks
- **taskwarrior** - active community
- **org-mode** - lots of features
- still need to look into a few other tools

## Other things I am working on
* Teaching myself **Python**
* Getting practice with *GitHub*
* jumping between window managers
* Looking for a job
